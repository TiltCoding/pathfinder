# Phases — what to do in each one

Each phase ends by updating `state.json` (phase, iteration, checkpoint, work-streams) and
`dashboard.json`. Spawn sub-agents with the Agent tool; pass them the slug and the absolute
workspace path. Keep the human's dashboard truthful at all times.

## 1. INTAKE

Goal: capture the task and stand up the workspace.

- **Queue mode (a `/improve` drain — see SKILL step 0):** if you popped an item from
  `.workflow/dispatch-queue.json`, the **brief already exists** at the item's `briefPath` — read it,
  do **not** re-elicit, and use the queue's `baseCommit`. Then go straight to EXPLORE. The rest of this
  step is for a normal, human-initiated task.
- Write `brief.md` from `templates/artifacts/brief.md`: title, goal, scope/non-scope, constraints,
  acceptance criteria, anything the user already specified. Ask the user only for blockers you truly
  cannot infer — keep it light; deeper questions come out of EXPLORE.
- Create `state.json` (see `state-schema.md`) with `phase: "INTAKE"`, `iteration: 0`. In a git repo,
  record `baseCommit` = `git rev-parse HEAD` so the dashboard's **«Изменения»** tab can diff the task's
  work against the starting point.
- Start the companion server and copy the dashboard (see `feedback-loop.md`). Write the first
  `dashboard.json` (summary from the brief, status `working`) and give the user the URL.
- If the task is being launched **in parallel** with another in-flight one, stand it up in its own
  git worktree at this point (see `parallel.md`) — that records `worktreePath`/`branch` in `state.json`.
- Advance to EXPLORE.

## 2. EXPLORE (autonomous)

Goal: understand the relevant code before planning.

- Spawn one to three `wf-explorer` agents in parallel. Split by area when the scope is broad
  (e.g. one for the data layer, one for the API, one for tests/build). For a narrow task, one is enough.
- Each explorer **reads `docs/knowledge/INDEX.md` first** (if present) to reuse prior knowledge, then
  fills the gaps by searching the code, and writes/extends `exploration.md` (RU): relevant files with
  clickable paths, entry points, existing patterns to reuse, constraints, risks, and **open questions**.
- Merge their findings into `exploration.md`, update `dashboard.json` (Карта кодовой базы), advance.

## 3. ELABORATE

Goal: turn understanding into a concrete, reviewable plan plus the questions you need answered.

- Spawn `wf-planner` with the brief + exploration. It produces a draft `plan.md` broken into
  **blocks** (each with a stable `id` like `b1`, `b2`) and a list of **open questions** in
  `questions.md` (each with a stable `id` like `q1`; mark choice-questions with options).
- When it helps the human decide, the planner also produces a **visual demo** of the solution: 2–3
  self-contained HTML/SVG variants in `.workflow/tasks/<slug>/mockups/` (UI mockups for UI tasks, a
  diagram/infographic for backend/CLI) plus a `demo` render model. It's optional — skip for trivial tasks.
- Render everything into `dashboard.json`: `planBlocks[]`, `questions[]`, and `demo` (if any). Set
  status `awaiting-batch`.
- Move to the PLAN GATE.

## 4. PLAN GATE (the one human gate)

Goal: converge on a plan the human approves. This is an iteration loop driven by batched feedback.

- Park at a checkpoint and wait (see `feedback-loop.md`): the human comments on plan blocks and
  answers questions in the dashboard, then clicks **«Отправить агенту на доработку»**.
- When a new `submissions/<n>.json` appears: read every item, revise `plan.md` / questions, and write
  a short `replies.json` entry per item (reference the block/question id) so the human sees the change.
  Bump `iteration`, refresh `dashboard.json`, park again.
- A **chosen demo variant** arrives as an answer keyed to the demo's `selectionId`. Record it in
  `state.json.questions`, fold the picked design into `plan.md` (and drop the alternatives from `demo`,
  or keep `selected` set to it), and reply under the variant so the human sees it's locked in.
- Repeat until the human clicks **«Утвердить план»** (an `approve-plan` signal). Then freeze
  `plan.md`, finalize `workstreams[]` in `state.json` (independent, parallelizable units, each with an
  id/title/status `todo`), and advance to IMPLEMENT.
- In headless/eval mode: skip waiting, auto-apply any pre-seeded submissions, auto-approve.

## 5. IMPLEMENT (autonomous, with optional steering)

Goal: build the approved plan and document it as you go.

- For each work-stream spawn a `wf-coder` agent. Independent streams run in parallel; long ones use
  `run_in_background`. Give each coder its work-stream, the plan, exploration, and the convention that
  it must read `docs/knowledge/` and match existing style.
- **In parallel, spawn `wf-documenter`** to grow `docs/knowledge/` as work-streams land (see
  `knowledge-guide.md`). It is a peer to the coders, not an afterthought.
- As streams complete, mark them `done` in `state.json` and `dashboard.json` and update progress.
- Between work-streams you hit checkpoints: if the human has submitted a steering batch **or sent chat
  messages** (`chat.jsonl`, see `feedback-loop.md`), consume them (answer in chat, adjust remaining
  streams) before continuing. Otherwise proceed autonomously. Chat never interrupts a running coder —
  it is handled at the next checkpoint.

## 6. VERIFY (autonomous)

Goal: confirm the change actually works.

- Spawn `wf-reviewer`: run the project's tests/linters/build, review the diff for correctness, and
  report findings. Fix or spawn a coder to fix real issues; re-run until green or until you have a
  clear blocker to surface.
- **Review gates (auto):** after `wf-reviewer` is green, run the `/code-review` and `/security-review`
  skills over the diff as gates. Capture each run into `reviews.json` (see `feedback-loop.md` for the
  shape): set `status: "running"` before you invoke the skill and rewrite it to `done`/`failed` with a
  short `summary` and the ranked `findings` (severity, `file:line`, text) when it returns. The
  dashboard's **«Изменения»** tab renders these and surfaces the change diff next to them. Treat
  high-severity findings as fix-or-justify before DONE. (In headless/eval mode, skip the gates.)
- A human can also request a re-run from the dashboard: the **`run-code-review`** / **`run-security-review`**
  signals arrive on your `/wait` baseline like any other signal — when you see one, re-run that skill
  and append a fresh entry to `reviews.json`.
- Have `wf-documenter` finalize: append the `task-log.md` entry, add an ADR for any notable decision,
  refresh `INDEX.md` and the root `CLAUDE.md` pointer.
- Update `dashboard.json` with verification status.

## 7. DONE

- Write a final summary into `dashboard.json` (what changed, where, how it was verified, follow-ups)
  and set status appropriately. Set `phase: "DONE"` in `state.json`.
- Tell the user what landed and point at the dashboard and the updated knowledge base.
- **Queue mode:** if this run drained a `.workflow/dispatch-queue.json` item, mark that item `done`
  (+`doneAt`) and bump the queue's `updatedAt`. Then tell the human how many items remain and the next
  step: **`/clear` then `/feature`** to start the next pending item in a fresh context (or **`/loop
  /feature`** to auto-continue). **Do not** start the next item in this same session — a clean context
  per feature is the point. If it was the last item, say the queue is drained and point at `/hub`.
